# Laravel Socialite
> A modified version of Laravel's official Socialite package.

### Modifications
- Base namespace changed to `Vinelab\Socialite`
- Re-structured directory and providers
- Added App-only functionality to the following services:
    - Facebook
    - Instagram
    - Twitter

> App-only functionality enables server-side communication with the service without
having to authenticate/redirect users.

## Introduction

Laravel Socialite provides an expressive, fluent interface to OAuth authentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub and Bitbucket. It handles almost all of the boilerplate social authentication code you are dreading writing.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for Socialite can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/authentication#social-authentication).
